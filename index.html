                        <strong>HOWDY!</strong> My name is Michael Cadieux, and I am a Senior Computer Science major, graduating in May 2023. 
                        I am in the Hullabaloo Band here at TAMU, meaning I get to play music at the Basketball, Volleyball, and Soccer games here on campus (I play Tenor Saxophone).
                        Some of my favorite hobbies that I've picked up recently are bowling and horticulture, both of which I've been able to take classes for over the past few years.
                        I recently built my own PC and am always looking to upgrade my hardware and peripherals. 
                        I love front-end development, even though you may not be able to tell from <em>this</em> website, oops!
                        I'm so excited to work with making websites accessible; not only do I come from a less tech-savvy family, but my mom is also disabled. 
                        She had an amputation of half of her left leg (long story, feel free to ask me about it), so accessible technology has always been something I've had to look for.
                        I truly can't wait to learn more about this subject, and I am so happy I get to learn this right before graduation and apply it directly to my first development job.
                        Thanks for reading!
                    </p>
